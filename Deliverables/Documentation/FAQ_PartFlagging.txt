Frequently Asked Questions For Part Flagging:

Q. How many part flags does it take for a part to get the label of "Non-Recommended"?
A. 100

Q: Can I downvote a part flag in the car builder?
A: No, because user reviews are meant to monitor the validity of the user who
   created the flag. If a user hasn't put a part in a build yet, they have
   no idea whether or not that part is incompatible.

Q: Why is there no part flagging for car posts?
A: The car posting feature of MotoMoto has not been created yet!
   For this reason, reviewing a flag is not available to a user.

The following questions and answers are only applicable to the non-existent car posts:
Q: Can I remove a flag from a car build?
A: No, flags cannot be removed by users; however, their impact may be lessened by downvoting
   the part flag in the Part Flagging Car Post page.

Q: Can I create a part flag for a part that does not exist in the part list.
A. No, because if the part does not exist in the part list for a particular car,
   then flagging it would have no effect.

Q. Do my reviews for a part flag actually affect the application?
A. Yes they do! Reviewing a part flag is just as impactful as creating one.
   It is based on a combination of part flags and part flag reviews that the
   "Compatible" and "Non-Recommended" labels are assigned to a part for a build.
