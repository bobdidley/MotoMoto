Frequently Asked Questions For Part Flagging:

Q: Why are there separate Part Flagging Car Builder and Part Flagging Car Post 
   pages from the regular Car Builder and Part Flagging Car Post pages?
A: Neither Car Builder or Car Post have been built yet, so in order to show frontend
   functionality for part flagging, temporary static pages for these features had to be built.

Q: Can I remove a flag from a car build?
A: No, flags cannot be removed by users; however, their impact may be lessened by downvoting
   the part flag in the Part Flagging Car Post page.

Q: Can I create a part flag for a part that does not exist in the part list.
A. No, because if the part does not exist in the part list for a particular car,
   then flagging it would have no effect.

Q. Do my reviews for a part flag actually affect the application?
A. Yes they do! Reviewing a part flag is just as impactful as creating one.
   It is based on a combination of part flags and part flag reviews that the
   "Compatible" and "Non-Recommended" labels are assigned to a part for a build.

Q. How many part flags does it take for a part to get the label of "Non-Recommended"?
A. 100
